The R package `bookdownplus` [@R-bookdownplus] is an extension of `bookdown` [@R-bookdown]. It is a collection of
multiple templates on the basis of LaTeX, which are tailored so that I can work happily under the umbrella of `bookdown`. `bookdownplus` helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries.

`bookdownplus` extends the features of `bookdown`, and simplifies the procedure. Users only have to choose a template, clarify the book title and author name, and then focus on writing the text. No need to struggle in YAML and LaTeX. 

With `bookdownplus` users can

-   record guitar chords,

-   write a mail in an elegant layout,

-   write a laboratory journal, or a personal diary,

-   draw a monthly or weekly or conference calendar,

-   and, of course, write academic articles in your favourite way,

-   with chemical molecular formulae and equations,

-   even in Chinese,

-   and more wonders will come soon.

Full documentation can be found in the book [R bookdownplus Textbook](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus). The webpage looks so-so, while the [pdf file](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus/bookdownplus.pdf) might give you a little surprise.

Although this section might not be the latest version, the general idea won't change. Please see [R bookdownplus Textbook](https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus) to keep up with the update.

## Preparation

Before starting, you have to install R, RStudio, bookdown package, and
other software and packages (i.e. Pandoc, LaTeX, rmarkdown, rticle,
knitr, etc.) which bookdown depends on. See the official [manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) of
bookdown for details. Additionally, if you want to produce a poster, phython must be installed before using, and the path of phython might have to be added to the environmental variables for Windows users.

## Installation

```
install.package("bookdownplus")
# or
devtools::install_github("pzhaonet/bookdownplus")
```

## Generate demo files

Run the following codes, and you will get some files (e.g. `index.Rmd`, `body.Rmd`, `bookdownplus.Rproj`) and folders in your working directory.

```
getwd() # this is your working directory. run setwd() to change it.
bookdownplus::bookdownplus()
```

## Build a demo book

Now open `bookdownplus.Rproj` with RStudio, and press `ctrl+shift+b` to compile it. Your will get a book file named `*.pdf` in `_book/`folder.

## Write your own

Write your own text in `index.Rmd` and `body.Rmd`, and build your own lovely book.

## More outputs

By default, the book is in a pdf file. From 'bookdownplus' 1.0.3, users can get more output formats, including 'word', 'html' and 'epub'. Run:

```
bookdownplus::bookdownplus(template = 'article', more_output = c('html', 'word', 'epub'))
```

## Recommendations

I have been developing some other packages, which bring more features into 'bookdown', such as:

- mindr [@R-mindr], which can extract the outline of your book and turn it into a mind map, and

- pinyin [@R-pinyin], which can automatically generate ['{#ID}'](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html) of the chapter headers even if there are Chinese characters in them.

Both of them have been released on CRAN and can be installed via:

```
install.packages('mindr')
install.packages('pinyin')
```

Enjoy your bookdowning!


## Models

Eq. \@ref(eq:mc2) is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
E = mc^2
  (\#eq:mc2)
\end{equation} 

It can be written as $E = mc^2$.
