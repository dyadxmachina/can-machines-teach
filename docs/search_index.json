Graphs are networks of dots and lines - Graph Theory (Dover Books) Mathematically speaking a graph consists of two sets. A set of vertexes and a set of edges \\[GRAPH_{v,e} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\\\ e_{2,1} &amp; e_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; e_{2,n} \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\] Google’s Knowledge Graph Google Knowledge Vault Problem Formulation Given we’ve impletemented the learning and feedback module, knowing where a given piece of education content fits into the knowledge space is a vital task if we want the knowledge footprint to make a learner predictable to others as well as being able to recommend new educational content that the learner can take on successfully. We will need the following things to connect educational content. A classifier to take a piece of educational content What we need A graph dedicated to education should do the following: - Provide flexibility for new subjects - Connect related subjects to each - Connect concepts Subject -&gt; Concepts 3.2 Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction There have been several papers that provide promising results to the automatation of constructing a knowledge graph but not as many in the domain of education. 3.3 Concept Extraction 3.4 Relation Extraction 3.4.1 Summary of Current Research and Needs [DRAFT] 3.5 Data and Annotation [DRAFT] 3.5.1 Reference [DRAFT] A Framework for Automatic Question Generation from Text using Deep Reinforcement Learning Learning to Ask: Neural Question Generation for Reading Comprehension Deep Attention Neural Tensor Network for Visual Question Answering Learning to Ask TOPIC-BASED QUESTION GENERATION Deep Learning based Recommender System "]
