<p>As mentioned above, we will be introducing a few novel concepts that we believe are the key components of such an educational ecosystem.</p>
<div id="knowledge-footprint" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Knowledge Footprint</h2>
<p>The concept of a knowledge footprint is one or more custom symbol(s) or badge(s) with a profile that represents one’s education relative to that of others. This concept is particularly designed for solving the second concern (knowledge representation) that we proposed earlier.</p>
<p>In turn, this footprint should encapsulate the information of all of one’s education (currently focused on digital) while balancing distinction and commonality with others.</p>

<p>A <strong>knowledge journey</strong> is a somewhat holistic view of all of the educational content a learner has acquired over time. The journey should be a temporal representation of all of the subjects that one has viewed and been tested on. Knowledge journey should be simple enough to comprehend and compare but complex enough that the individual can go back to any particular moment in time and review the educational content they’ve viewed before. Coupled with the knowledge graph, it can also shed light on the possible next education content that a learner should be or would be interested in learning.</p>
<p>This concept also helps address the knowledge representation concern. This time instead of capturing a consolidated snapshot of one’s current knowledge profile, this concept takes a temporal route to capture one’s entire learning path.</p>

# Implementation</p>
<p>In this section, we set out to answer the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might we approach designing such a knowledge ecosystem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will take a tour through a relevant set of implementations of the elements within the proposed knowledge ecosystem. We will present the relevant research in machine learning for each of the elements and also propose a new artificial neural network architecture, Educational Content to Question Answer (DeepEdu) network, with the details needed to design such a network.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-formulation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Problem Formulation</h2>
<p>Building such a knowledge ecosystem is a non-trivial task. As we discussed earlier, here are a few key elements of our ecosystem:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Learning + Feedback [DeepEdu]</strong> – given a learner views a single educational content, reliably evaluate their knowledge and provide feedback for improvement to support learning (credibility, rigour)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge Graph</strong> – relate any educational content to a concept which belongs to a particular subject, (relatibility, predictability)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge Journeys</strong> – given educational content, a learner’s score on such content, and history of viewing and testing use the knowledge graph to map the learner’s journey over time, offer a way for a learner to compare, connect with, and follow another’s journey (compare, traverse)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge Footprint</strong> – given a learner’s journey, collapse it into a representative symbol(s) (relatability, stable but evolving system )</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Much of element two (#2) and element one (#1) is possible with the recent breakthroughs in the machine learning and deep learning. Elements three (#3) and (#4) may require a different approach to tie the other elements together. We see #3 and #4 as design problems to be approached from the bottom up. In this section, we will mainly focus on the first two (#1 &amp; #2) elements.</p>
<div id="before-we-start" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Before we start…</h3>
<p>As discussed above, recent trends in deep learning have produced state-of-art results on many of the tasks that are needed in our system.</p>
<p>To best illustrate the problem and the possible solutions, we will focus solely on a specific type of educational content educational videos (i.e.Youtube or how-to videos). Keep in mind that our ultimate goal is to apply our approaches to any type of educational content including open texts, digital texts, audio or podcasts.</p>
<p>Let us now explore some of the recent research findings that would enable us to bring our knowledge ecosystem to live.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1</span> Problem Formulation</h3>
<p>In short, in this section we will be providing some insights into how to solve the following puzzle:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2</span> The Approach</h3>
<p>We consider learning + feedback as a key component of our ecosystem which would settle our concerns of passive knowledge consumption and untested knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on the above concerns we’ll take a novel approach to ensure that our DeepEdu networks can do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Generate a set of questions and answers for any educational content (Domain: Question and Answer Generation)</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate closed and open-ended answers (Domain: Automatic Answer Evaluation)</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a score for the content based on the learner’s performance (Domain: Aggregate scoring)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The ideal result is to test the learner’s knowledge by asking questions and evaluating responses given a set of concepts and the learner’s history knowledge.</p>
<p>Now let’s start exploring some solutions that are made possible with the most recent deep learning models.</p>
</div>
<div id="qg-and-qa-overview" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.3</span> QG and QA Overview</h3>
<p>In previous years, deep learning research has taken up a similar problem titled Question Generation (QG) and Question Answering (QA).</p>
<p>Question Generation (QG) was originally part of NLP. The goal of QG is to generate questions according to some given information. It could be used in many different scenarios (i.e. generating questions for reading comprehension, generating data from large-scale question-answering pairs or even generating questions from images). Earlier approaches to QG mainly used human-crafted rules and patterns to transform a descriptive sentence to a related question. Recent neural network-based approaches represent the state-of-art of most of those tasks and these approaches have been successfully used to solve many other NLP tasks (i.e. neural machine translation, summarization, etc.), as the training optimization studies progress, the stability and performance improvements could enhance our ability to generate relevant questions and answers.</p>
<p>As for generating correct answers to questions, Question Answering (QA), this is one of the most popular research domains in NLP just as well. Recently, QA has also been used to develop dialogue systems and chatbots designed to simulate human conversation.</p>
<p>Traditionally, most of the research used a collection of conventional linguistically-based NLP techniques (i.e. parsing, part-of-speech tagging and coreference resolution. However, with recent advances in deep learning, neural network models have shown promising results. Further improvements (i.e.attention mechanism and memory networks) allow the network to focus on the most relevant facts such that they can reach the new state-of-art performance for QA.</p>
<p>Now we have some basic understanding of these 2 tasks for which we will be expanding more in depth later. Consider the next question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“what types of questions &amp; answers would be best to test a learner’s knowledge given a piece of educational content (i.e. a lecture video)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a learner is watching a video about hypothesis testing and, midway through the video, the educator shows an example and provides the data needed to test the hypothesis. It would be very beneficial for a learner if during this time his/her knowledge is tested with the following example questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the definition of the p-value? (multiple choice)</p></li>
<li><p>Is this a 1-sided test? (YES or NO)</p></li>
<li><p>How would you interpret the p-value in the context of this example? (open-ended)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis based on the previous comparison? (open-ended)</p></li>
<li><p>Give me a quick summary about what you have learned through this video or this example. (Open-ended)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As shown above, we would call questions #1 and #2 the close-ended questions; question #3 and #4 the specific open-ended questions; and question #5 a general open-ended question.</p>
<p>Based on the above information, we can update our question formulation into:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Generate close-ended question + answers pairs</p></li>
<li><p>Generate specific open-ended question + answers pairs</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and comment on the general open-ended answers</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of the close-ended questions, the answers can be well defined and evaluated. However, the process might be more complex for the open-ended ones. We will approach each of them here from the current research perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Why deep learning? </strong></p>
<p>As we stated above, deep learning has achieved state-of-art performance in both QG and QA tasks, but how?</p>
<p>If you pay close attention to QG and QA type of problems, you can easily reframe the problem into the one in which the model is expected to learn the relationship between the input (educational content) and the output (meaningful question &amp; answer pairs). In other words, if we can provide the needed data for the model, the model will learn a function that captures the relationship between our input and output, or, appropriately map the educational content to the desired question and answer pairs.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, deep learning is one of the most optimal techniques currently developed for learning such complex representations of complex data such as video lectures.</p>
<p>By definition, machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that uses statistical learning techniques to give the machine the ability to learn from the data. It explores the algorithms that can be used to parse data, learn from the data, and then apply what they have learned to make an inference. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that belongs to the family of representation learning. Inside this family, deep learning is particularly good at sampling the features and having additional layers for more abstract feature learning. All of these special properties are crucial for building our DeepEdu networks.</p>
<p>Moreover, deep learning is known as one of the most flexible machine learning algorithms for learning and mapping a <strong>deep representation</strong> of supervised concepts within the data. Deep neural network architecture can be composed into a single differentiable function and trained end-to-end until it converges. As a result, they can help identify the suitable <em>inductive</em> <em>biases</em> catered to the training data.</p>
<p>Specifically, deep learning outperforms other techniques when the training data size is large. In our case, we could easily find a large amount of educational content available on the web.</p>
<p>Having a large amount of training data is very troublesome if you plan to do feature engineering manually. When there is a lack of domain understanding for feature introspection, deep learning is preferable.</p>
<p>In the end, deep learning really shines when it comes to many specialized research problems such as NLP, Visual Recognition and Speech recognition. For creating our DeepEdu, all those domains will be involved.</p>

<div id="question-generation-qg" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.4</span> Question Generation (QG)</h3>
<p>Let’s begin with question generation (QG) task.</p>
<p>The ideal goal of an automatic question generation is to generate a question <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> that is syntactically and semantically correct, relevant to the context and match to a set of answers.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, we need to train an algorithm to learn the underlying conditional probability distribution</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{\theta}(Q|X)\]</span></p>
<p>parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. In other words, we can think of this problem as the one that requires the model to learn a function (with a set of parameters) <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> during the training stage using content-question and/or answer sets so that the probability/likelihood <span class="math inline">\(P_{\theta}(Q|P)\)</span> is maximized over the given training dataset.</p>
<p>We can also think of this problem as a typical seq2seq (sequence-to-sequence) learning problem since both the input and the output are a sequence of text character that the model needs to process and learn from. But in our case, we would like to take any media type and map it to a character output.</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In this paper <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~shitingl/papers/18l@s-qgen.pdf">QG-Net: A Data-Driven Question Generation Model for Educational Content</a> <span class="citation">(Wang <a href="#ref-zichaowang">2018</a>)</span>. They use a bi-directional LSTM network to process the input context words sequence. Encoding the answer into context word vectors.</li>
</ol>
<p>QG-Net generates questions by iteratively sampling question words from the conditional probability distribution <span class="math display">\[P(Q|C,A,\theta)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> denotes a set of parameters. In order to construct the probability distribution, they first create a <strong>context reader</strong> that processes each word <span class="math inline">\(c_j\)</span> in the input context and turns it into a fix-sized representation <span class="math inline">\(h_j\)</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, they also have a <strong>question generator</strong> that generates the question text word-by-word, given all context word representation and the set of question words in previous time steps.</p>
<p>As for quantitative evaluation, they aimed to minimize the difference between the generated question and the true question in the training set during training using the standard back-propagation through time with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm to learn the model parameters. To ensure the performance, they employ <em>teacher forcing</em> procedure for training the LSTM with a standard implementation of beam search, a greedy but effective approximation, to exhaustively search and select the top 25 candidate output question sentences. The final one would be the one with the lowest negative log likelihood.</p>
<p>The high-level QG-Net architecture is as below:</p>

<li>In this paper <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rk3pnae0b">Topic-based Question Generation</a> <span class="citation">(authors <a href="#ref-anonymous">2018</a>)</span>, they propose a topic-based question generation algorithm. The algorithm is able to take in an input sentence, a topic and a question type and generate a word sequence related to the topic, question type and the input sentence.</li>
</ol>
<p>They formulate a conditional likelihood objective function as mentioned before to the model to learn.</p>
<p>Also, they go through a few general frameworks that have been employed for solving a similar problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first one is the <em>seq2seq model</em> that uses a bidirectional LSTM as the encoder to encode a sentence and an LSTM RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) as the decoder to generate the target question.</p></li>

<li><p>The last approach is <em>multi-source seq2seq learning</em> which aims to integrate information from multiple sources to boost learning.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04961.pdf">A Framework for Automatic Question Generation from Text using Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> <span class="citation">(Kumar <a href="#ref-vishwajeet">2018</a>)</span>, they implement a reinforcement learning(RF) framework that consists of a generator and an evaluator for this task.</li>
</ol>
<p>They refer to <em>the generator</em> part of the model as the <span class="math inline">\(agent\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(action\)</span> of the agent is to generate the next work in the question. The probability of decoding a word is <span class="math display">\[P_{\theta}(word)\]</span> with a stochastic policy.</p>
<p><em>The evaluator</em> part of the model then assigns a <span class="math inline">\(reward\)</span> to the output sequence predicted using the current <span class="math inline">\(policy\)</span> given by the generator. Based on the reward assigned by the evaluator, the generator updates and improves its current policy. In short, the goal in RL-based question generation is to find a policy that can maximize the sum of the <em>expected return</em> at the end of the sequence generation.</p>
<p>** Summary **</p>
<p>In this QG section, we have discussed 3 different algorithms. Based on our learning, we conclude that a generative seq2seq model might be a suitable option for this task. As for our objective function, we should be formulating a conditional probability distribution that is conditioned on the provided content (i.e. the video) and answers. As suggested, we can use a bi-directional LSTM RNN as the encoder to encode the content and an LSTM RNN as the decoder to generate the question.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.5</span> Question Answering (QA)</h3>
<p>Now, let’s move on to our question answering (QA) task. The general goal of QA is to predict the answer to a question based on the information found in the passage, given a passage and a question. By solving this task, our DeepEdu network should be able to easily evaluate the answer provided by learners and achieve full automation of learning + feedback cycle.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of a basic QA model’s implementation <span class="citation">(Kostadinov <a href="#ref-qa_imp">2017</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Build representation for the passage and the question separately;</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate the question information into the passage;</p></li>
<li><p>Get the final representation of the passage by directly matching it against itself;</p></li>
<li><p>Generate the answer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And the typical mechanisms applied for solving such a problem include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Embedding</p></li>
<li><p>Encoder Decoder</p></li>
<li><p>Attention Mechanism</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Close-ended Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Visual Question Answering (VQA)</strong></p>
<p>VQA is a challenging research problem that focuses on providing a natural language answer given any image and any free-form natural language question. As we are focused on video educational content first, our problem will include both NLP and visual recognition tasks. We figure VQA should be a great approach to start with.</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In this paper <a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Yalong_Bai_Deep_Attention_Neural_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf">Deep Attention Neural Tensor Network for Visual Question Answering</a> <span class="citation">(Bai <a href="#ref-yalong">2018</a>)</span>, they propose a novel <em>deep attention neural tensor network</em> that can discover the joint correlation over images, questions and answers with tensor-based representation.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for their workflow, the model one of the pairwise interaction (i.e. between image and question) by <strong>bilinear features</strong>, which is further encoded with the third dimension (i.e. answer) to be a triplet using a bilinear tensor product. During this step, the model takes in a question + a corresponding image + candidate answers as the input. A CNN (convolutional neural network) and a GRU RNN are used for extracting feature vectors and question respectively. Then the representation is passed on as a <em>multi-modal feature</em> and integrated by a <strong>bilinear pooling</strong> module. Moreover, they decompose the correlation of triplets by their question and answer types with a <strong>slice-wise attention module</strong> on the tensor to select the most discriminative reasoning process inference.</p>
<p>In the end, they optimize the proposed network by learning a label regression with KL-divergence losses. They claimed that these techniques enable them to do scalable training and fast convergence over a large number of answer set. During the inference stage, they feed the embeddings of all candidate answer into the network and then select the answer which has the biggest triplet relevance score as the final answer.</p>
<p>The high-level network architecture is as follows:</p>

<li>In this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02088.pdf">Question Type Guided Attention in Visual Question Answering</a>, they propose a model called <strong>Question Type-guided Attention (QTA)</strong>. This model utilizes the information of question type to dynamically balance visual features from both top-down and bottom-up orders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, they propose a <em>multi-task extension</em> that is trained to predict question types from the lexical inputs during training which generalizes into applications that lack question type, with a minimal performance loss.</p>
<p>As for their main contribution, they focus on developing an attention mechanism that can exploit high-level semantic information on the question type to guide the visual encoding process.</p>

<p>They collect 408 subtitled movies and obtained their extended summaries in the form of <strong>plot synopses</strong>(movie summaries that fans write after watching the movie) from Wikipedia.

Time-stamp is also attached to each question and answer pair.</p>
<p>In the second step of data collection, they used the multiple-choice answers and question collected as the input to show to a different group of annotators. By doing so, annotators could re-formulate the question and answers for a sanity check.</p>
<p>** Summary **</p>
<p>By going through the previous examples, we can see that VQA and a few similar algorithms are designed to efficiently process image and text input while making the inference based on it.</p>
<p>First, the key components for creating and training a VQA model include feature selection, feature pooling and a specially designed attention mechanism. The input of the model is typically a video clip + question + answer pairs. A CNN and sometimes an RNN is needed for such a task.</p>
<p>Another important learning is that we can follow the steps described in MovieQA example to collect and annotate our training data by asking crowd-sourcing workers to construct the question and answer pairs. Also, more advanced algorithms like multi-stream hierarchical attention context network might be necessary for a better performance.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Question-Answering Model</strong></p>
<p>Both Question Generation(QG) and Question Answering(QA) are two well-defined sets of problems that aim to either infer a question or an answer given the counterpart based on the context. However, they are usually explored separately despite their intrinsic complementary relationship. However, our DeepEdu network needs to take on both roles simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might we solve this issue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s look into a few algorithms are designed for this.</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>

<p>In short, the model is composed of the following components: embedding layer, encoding layer, attention layer and the output layer. The model is fed with a question-context-answer triplet <span class="math inline">\((Q,C,A)\)</span> and the decoded Q and A from the output layer. Their loss function consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>negative log-likelihood loss</li>
<li>a coverage loss (penalize repetition of the generated text)</li>
</ul>

<p>In their task formulation part, they clarify that they break this task into 2 sub-tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>candidate answer extraction</li>
<li>answer-specific question generation</li>
</ul>
<p>To complete the tasks, they first identify a set of question-worthy candidate answer set <span class="math inline">\(ans = (A1, A2,...Ai)\)</span>. For each candidate answer <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span>, they then aim to generate a question <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> -a sequence of tokens <span class="math inline">\({y1,y2,...yn}\)</span> - based on the sentence S that contains candidate <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> such that

</ol>
<p>In achieving their goal, they leverage the <strong>dual learning</strong> framework that is proposed in machine translation area initially, which uses <span class="math inline">\(A-to-B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B-to-A\)</span> translation models to form two closed translation loops and let them teach each other through a <em>reinforcement learning process</em>.</p>

The model follows the classic <em>encoder-decoder</em> framework. The <strong>multi-perspective matching encoder</strong> that they are implementing is a bi-directional LSTM RNN model that takes a passage and a query as input and perform query understanding by matching it with the passage from multiple perspectives;</li>
</ol>
<p>The decoder is a<strong>attention-based LSTM RNN</strong> model with <em>copy and coverage</em> mechanism. In the QG task, a question will be generated from the model given the passage and the target answer; whereas in the QA task, the answer will be generated given the question and the passage.</p>
<p>They also leverage a <em>policy-gradient reinforcement learning</em> algorithm to overcome <em>exposure bias</em> (a major problem resulted from sequence learning with cross-entropy loss function).</p>
<p>The case both QG and QA tasks into one process by firstly matching the input passage against the query, then generating the output based on the matching results.</p>
<p>As for the training, they first pre-train the model with cross-entropy loss and then fine-tune the model parameters with policy-gradient reinforcement learning to alleviate the exposure bias problem. They end up adopting a similar sampling strategy as the scheduled sampling strategy for generating the sampled output during the reinforcement learning process.</p>
<p>** Summary **</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, QG and QA tasks are intrinsically bounded and one cannot find the solution for either of them without taking the other party into account.</p>
<p>In this section, we have discussed some approaches that many groups of people have taken to help the machine operate on both tasks simultaneously.</p>
<p>For our problem, it is very motivating to see the current progress and how much we can learn from their approaches. In sum, our general setup is most similar to the dual learning framework. We need to tie QG and QA together and also map it to concepts. In the first diagram of the section, we can see that they connect the loss function from both sides of the model and it is very similar to the strategy adopted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GAN</a> (Generative adversarial network). Some advanced mechanisms are proposed as well for effectively solving these tasks (i.e. symmetric hierarchical attention and policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Open-ended Question</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem Formulation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-ended questions bring clarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we mentioned above, the open-ended question could be roughly split into two categories. A general open-ended question or a specific open-ended question.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, these two categories are not that particular distinct since both problems require the system to draw a conclusion based on the context and question provided. As for the answer, it is allowed to have a pretty high degree of freedom. Therefore, our system should be able to evaluate the answer with relatively flexible rules or standards including flexibility in media type.</p>
<p>Based on our assumptions, we will combine these two problems into one for our investigation.</p>
<p>It may appear unapproachable at first glance to teach a system to generate correct answers for and evaluate open-ended answers. Again, we need to reframe our problem and then break it apart.</p>
<p>Based on our research, we believe it is helpful to think of this type of issue as a particular type of QA problem; the difference is that after the QA procedure, we need to match and evaluate the answers generated by the machine and the learner such that we can provide an adequate evaluation.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at an existing knowledge evaluation system that has been used for grading the essays automatically - <strong>Automated essay scoring (AES)</strong>. AES focuses on automatically analyzing the quality and assigning a score to a given writing. AES systems rely not only on grammars, but also on more complex features such as semantics, discourse and pragmatics.</p>
<p>It has four general types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Essay Grade: it is known as the first AES system.</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligent Essay Assessor: it is using Latent Semantic Analysis features</p></li>
<li><p>E-rater: it has been used by the ETS to score essay portion of GMAT</p></li>
<li><p>IntelliMetric: it is developed and used by the College Board for placement purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some research findings we consider as useful for our unified goal.</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In this paper <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1024">Neural Automated Essay Scoring and Coherence Modeling for Adversarially Crafted Input</a> <span class="citation">(Farag <a href="#ref-youmna">2018</a>)</span>, they develop a network that can effectively learn connectedness features between sentences and propose a framework for integrating and jointly training the local coherence model with a state-of-art AES.</li>
</ol>
<p>They examine the robustness of the AES model on adversarially crafted input and specifically focus on input related to local coherence; A local coherence model can evaluate the writing based on its ability to rank coherently ordered sequence of sentences higher than their counterparts.</p>
<p>The models they used are <em>Local Coherence (LC)</em> model and LSTM AES model. The first model has 2 main parts: sentence representation and clique representation; and the second model is a combined model that does vector concatenation and joint learning.</p>

</ol>
<p>They present the adaptive hierarchical encoder network to learn the joint representation of the long-form video contents according to the question with adaptive video segmentation. They also develop the reinforced decoder network to generate the neural language answer for open-ended video question answering. Meanwhile, they construct a large-scale dataset for open-ended long-form video QA and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>
<p>The framework of <strong>Adaptive Hierarchical Reinforced Networks</strong> is are below:</p>

The network framework that they introduce is called <em>hredGAN</em> that is based on <em>conditional GANs</em>. The generator part of the model is a modified <strong>hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder network (HRED)</strong> and the discriminator is a word-level bi-directional LSTM RNN that shares context and word embedding with the generator.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the inference step, <em>noise sampling</em> is conditioned on the dialogue history and is used to perturb the generator’s latent space for generating possible responses. The final response is the one ranked the best by the discriminator.</p>
<p>In sum, their hredGAN combines both generative and retrieval-based multi-turn dialogue systems to improve the model’s performance. One of the special design of the model is that the generator and the discriminator share the context and word embedding and this allows for joint end-to-end training using back-propagation.</p>
<p>** Summary **</p>
<p>Based on our limited research, we find that it is achievable to generate the answers for open-ended questions based on the educational video and provide appropriate feedback/rating based on the current techniques. The first paper presents a newly developed AES model that rates learner’s writing by taking into account a specified metrics. It also demonstrates a possible approach to enhance any given AES model by training it with the adversarially crafted input.</p>
<p>In the second paper, we investigate a network that is able to answer the open-ended questions based on the video and a given question. The Adaptive Hierarchical Reinforced Networks they proposed is composed of hierarchical encoder networks and the reinforced decoder networks. It is possible for us to adopt their general framework trained with our educational video data specifically.</p>
<p>Similar to the second paper, the last paper indicates that we can generate responses conditioned on the context. By leveraging conditional GAN framework, their model performs very well on this task.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.6</span> Summary of Learning and Feedback Networks</h3>

<p>There is also plenty of research has also been done in open-ended question answering realm. Though the performance may not be guaranteed, some techniques presented above are greatly relevant and thought-provoking such as AES model and open-ended question answering networks.</p>
<p>Current research is promising but we need more research and innovation in this area.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.7</span> Datasets and Annotation Suggested</h3>
<p>In order to approach this problem from scratch, we need to create our own dataset for which we will provide some related resources to start with:</p>

As you can see from its introduction, it comes with precomputed audio-visual features from billions of frames and audio segments. In short, we can expect the following content from this dataset:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>the dataset consists of 6.1M videos URLs, labelled with a vocabulary of 3863 visual entities</p></li>
<li><p>the video-level dataset comes out to be 18 GB in size, while the frame-level features are approximately 1.3 TB</p></li>
<li><p>it comes with pre-extracted audio &amp; visual features from every second of video.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though the video content is not limited to the education category, we can still use it to get a strong baseline model.</p>
<p>Naturally, the next step would be to constrain our model to train particularly on educational content. The data needed for training may include the raw video clip, annotation/caption of the whole video content, and question + answer pairs (including the timestamps).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Knowledge Graph</h2>
<p>Learning is a journey of knowledge accumulation and experience To create an adequate knowledge ecosystem requires us to first figure out what ‘knowledge’ really is and how to best represent it. <em>Knowledge Graph</em> is used as one of the tools to help make sense of what type or category acquired ‘knowledge’ is and what it is related to. You can think of knowledge graphs as a collection of relational facts, where each fact states that a certain relation holds between 2 entities.</p>
<p>In this section, we will be discussing how we can construct our education specific knowledge graph from scratch.</p>
<div id="what-is-a-graph" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.1</span> What is a graph?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Graphs are networks of dots and lines - Graph Theory (Dover Books)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mathematically speaking, graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made of vertices, nodes, or points which are connected by edges, arcs or lines. Typically a graph consists of two sets. A set of vertexes and a set of edges as below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[GRAPH_{v,e} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  v_{1,1} &amp; a_{1,2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1,n} \\

 \end{pmatrix}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-knowledge-graphkg" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.2</span> What is a Knowledge Graph(KG)?</h3>
<p>As for the knowledge graph, it is a graph representation of a knowledge base. One of the most popular knowledge graphs is the multi-relational graph used by Google and its services to enhance the search engine’s results with information gathered from a variety of sources. Per Wikipedia, <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/#knowledge_graph_entities">Google’s Knowledge Graph</a> <span class="citation">(Google <a href="#ref-googlekg">2015</a>)</span> uses a graph database to provide structured and detailed information about the topic in addition to a list of links to other sites.</p>
<p>In general, a knowledge graph represents a knowledge domain. It connects the objects and facts of different types in a systematic way. Knowledge graphs encode knowledge arranged in a network of nodes and links rather than tables and columns. With knowledge graphs, people and machines can easily capture and utilize a dynamically growing semantic network of facts about things. In other words, we can use it to connect the facts related to people, processes, applications, data and many other custom objects as well as their relationships among them with a structured knowledge graph.</p>
<p>Also, plenty of successful applications show that people have applied knowledge graph successfully and efficiently to a variety of domains (i.e. to support semantic search(i.e. Google’s Knowledge Graph), personal assistant(i.e. Apple’s Siri) and deep question answering (i.e. Wolfram Alpha and IBM’s Watson).</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-formulation-2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.3</span> Problem Formulation</h3>
<p>Given we’ve implemented the learning and feedback module, knowing where a given piece of education content fits into the knowledge space is a vital task if we want the knowledge footprint to make a learner predictable to others as well as being able to recommend new educational content that the learner can take on successfully. We will need the following things to connect our educational content:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A classifier to take a piece of educational content</p></li>
<li><p>A hierarchical algorithm that can map the relationship of the related content based on their hierarchy in the knowledge graph</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) A probabilistic algorithm (i.e. Bayesian network to map the strength/significance of their relationship with each other</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In our case, a graph dedicated to education should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide flexibility to add new subjects</p></li>
<li><p>Connect related subjects to each</p></li>
<li><p>Map concepts with the subject</p></li>
<li><p>Connect concepts related to the content</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As shown before, here is how our graph will be used to support our ecosystem as a whole:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.4</span> Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction</h3>
<p>Classic knowledge representation techniques allow a knowledge engineer to create rules that can be interpreted by a reasoner to infer new or missing triples(subject, predicate, object). These rules are usually expressed through an ontology which allows for the propagation of properties from top classes to the lower classes.</p>
<p>However, we are looking for solutions that can allow us to complete our educational knowledge graph construction process automatically. Based on our research, generic knowledge graphs usually cannot sufficiently support many domain-specific applications (i.e. education) and finding the representation of the graph to feed the triples into a machine learning algorithm is still an open area of research.</p>
<p>As a start, let’s focus on how we can automate our knowledge graph construction process.</p>
<p><strong>Key Components</strong></p>
<p>Here are some key components that worth highlighting before we dive deep into the possible solutions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p>More importantly, it adopts the <em>neural sequence labelling algorithm</em> on pedagogical data to extract instruction concepts. They then employ <em>probabilistic association rule mining</em> on learning assessment data to identify the significance of each of the relations.</p>

<p>In short, they present a <em>probabilistic interpretation</em> of existing knowledge graph embedding models. By reformulating the models like ComplEx and DistMult, they construct the generative models for relational facts.</p>
<p>They also apply <em>stochastic variational inference</em> to estimate an approximate posterior for each entity and relation embedding in the knowledge graph.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.6</span> Summary</h3>
<p>A significant amount progress has been made in automating knowledge graph using deep learning and other machine learning techniques based on our research.</p>
<p>The first paper introduces a system that almost exactly matches our goal. They also demonstrate the current progress and possible solutions for solving each of the obstacles to developing an education based knowledge graph. In sum, for the instructional concept extraction task, they use a CRF model and a neural sequence labelling algorithm and they have proved effective for the task. They adopt a probabilistic data mining technique in learning assessment data to approximate the relations with educational significance.</p>
<p>The last 2 papers demonstrate the progress that has been made in KG embedding learning domain. As mentioned above, it is one of the most effective methods in representing knowledge graphs.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Knowledge Journeys</h2>
<p>A collective knowledge graph is our ecosystem’s backbone. It can be applied universally to some extent, but a learner’s learning journey is highly personal and unique at the individual’s level. Every learner enters the system with their own set of problems that they are curious about and their specific missions towards the mastery. As a result, their knowledge journeys should vary significantly. As for our role, we need to ensure we have a system that can handle these high degrees of freedom. Or more ideally, to adaptively represent and learn from a learner’s history, interests, and whom they are related to best support their knowledge acquisition adventure.</p>
<div id="problem-formulation-3" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.1</span> Problem Formulation</h3>
<p>Below are few key makeups of our knowledge journeys:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First, we need to have a system that can match all the content that a learner has acquired back to the collective educational knowledge graph;</p></li>
<li><p>Generate their personal knowledge graph with the timestamps on each content and the subject(s) it belongs to;</p></li>
<li><p>Unfold the timestamps and map the previous generated static knowledge graph onto a timeline and display a learner’s knowledge as a personal knowledge acquisition storyline/gallery;</p></li>
<li><p>Adaptively update the journey along with a learner’s learning progress.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As the outcome, a learner’s knowledge journey will be available anytime for the learner to look through and it makes it possible for them to easily go back in time to review a particular piece of content they have learned and for others to unfold their learning journey along the timeline for more details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="knowledge-footprint-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.10</span> Knowledge Footprint</h2>
<p>Just a quick review of the concept, a learner’s knowledge footprint is going to be represented as one or more badges or symbols that act as a thumbnail view of a learner’s knowledge profile at a specific time point. In a sense, it will continuously evolve and be modified when a learner proceeds his/her learning journey. By constructing such symbol(s), a learner can easily understand their current knowledge profile relative to their past’s and to other’s and to timely make an adjustment to alter their future learning plan.</p>
<p>As for the implementation, we would consider employing the unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques to help uncover and represent the visible and invisible dimensions of a learner’s knowledge journey. In turn, the model can consolidate and collapse the journey into one or more symbols to accurately represent a learner’s current knowledge profile. Still, it is not a trivial task and we believe it is going to be a teamwork that requires people like machine learning and deep learning researchers, educators, and designers to work collaboratively for the best possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Note that we will not discuss the detailed research findings or implementation steps of Knowledge Journeys and Knowledge Footprint elements in this essay. We will leave these areas for our future research.</p>
<div id="possible-next-steps" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.10.1</span> Possible Next Steps</h3>
<p>As a reasonable next step, we would also like our system to be as personalized as possible so as to provide guidance for a learner along their knowledge journey, given that our system has already encoded and possessed the information of a learner’s knowledge footprint and journey.</p>
<p>In this case, a recommender system might be a desirable choice for handling such a job since it is an intuitive line of defence against consumer over-choice given the ever-growing educational content available on the web.</p>
