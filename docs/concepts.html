<div id="knowledge-footprint" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Knowledge Footprint</h2>
<p>The concept of a knowledge footprint is a custom symbol or badge with a profile that represents one’s education relative to that of others. This concept is particularly designed for solving the second the knowledge representation concern that we proposed earlier.</p>
<p>In turn, this footprint should be able to represent all of one’s education (currently focused on digital) while balancing distinction and commonality with others.</p>
<p><em>This example from Aminer is a good visual for a knowledge footprint and journey.</em> <img src="img/aminer.png" alt="Example at aminer.com" /></p>

<p>A <strong>knowledge journey</strong> is a somewhat holistic view of all of the educational content a learner has acquired over time. The journey should be a temporal representation of all of the subjects that one has viewed and been tested on. Knowledge journey should be simple enough to comprehend and compare but complex enough that the individual can go back to any particular moment in time and review the educational content they’ve viewed before. Coupled with the knowledge graph, it can also shed light on the possible next education content that a learner should be or would be interested learning.</p>
<p>This concept also helps address the knowledge representation concern. This time instead of capturing a consolidated snapshot of one’s current knowledge, this concept takes a temporal route to capture one’s entire learning path.</p>

<p>The collective human knowledge graph can be compared to Google’s Search Knowledge Graph <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="googlekg"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> which points unstructured information towards structure. The graph should have all existing subjects that we are currently aware of (i.e. Mathematics, Computer Science, Art, and Sociology, etc). Since each piece of educational content will be classified into one more more sub-subject(s), all subjects will exist in detail within the knowledge graph.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we could also use these subjects that are associated with that piece of content to help create the knowledge footprint for the learner.</p>

<div id="ec2qa-network" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> EC2QA Network</h2>
<p>We mentioned the EC2QA network earlier because currently we would have to cobble together multiple networks to make this work. Instead we will introduce a novel network framework, EC2QA, to solve the problem of generating questions and answer pairs for any given educational content (text, video, image, pdf, etc).</p>
<p>The possible implementation solutions are introduced in the implementation section.</p>

<p>Now that we are aware of each of the elements, let’s talk about how they work in practice.</p>
<p>A learner watches a video titled ‘Depression’ by Robert Sapolsky.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The video is classified by a neural network as the following subjects [Neuroscience, Mental Health, Psychology];</p></li>
<li><p>The subjects are then mapped to the <strong>knowledge graph</strong> which gives us more information about each subject;</p></li>
<li><p>Using EC2QA or similar, a set of questions and answers are generated for every 15* minutes of video;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A learner is present with 5 questions to answer and scores 4/5 (80%).</p>
<ul>
<li>The link between user and video takes up the score;</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the video, the learner records a video summary and is evaluated with a score 7/10 (70%).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The evaluation network looks at the <strong>semantic and conceptual mutual information</strong> shared between the original content and the learner’s video summary;</p></li>
<li><p>All scores are mapped to the video and also counted at the subject level;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A learner looks at their knowledge footprint.</p>
<ul>
<li>All scores should be calculated against all subjects coming from the knowledge graph and compared against other learners to generate the footprint.</li>
</ul>
