Now we will consider the knowledge graph as the backbone.

## What is a graph?
> Graphs are networks of dots and lines - Graph Theory (Dover Books)

Mathematically speaking a graph consists of two sets. A set of vertexes and a set of edges
$$GRAPH_{v,e} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  v_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  e_{2,1} & e_{2,2} & \cdots & e_{2,n} \\
 \end{pmatrix}$$

Problem Formulation

Given we've impletemented the learning and feedback module, knowing where a given piece of education content fits into the knowledge space is a vital task if we want the knowledge footprint to make a learner predictable to others as well as being able to recommend new educational content that the learner can take on successfully. We will need the following things to connect educational content.

> A classifier to take a piece of educational content

What we need

A graph dedicated to education should do the following:
- Provide flexibility for new subjects
- Connect related subjects to each
- Connect concepts

Subject -> Concepts

## Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction
There have been several papers that provide promising results to the automatation of constructing a knowledge graph but not as many in the domain of education. 

## Concept Extraction

## Relation Extraction
